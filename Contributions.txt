I mainly worked within the roles/users/test folder, but both of us ended up working in all sections 
at times whenever one of us needed help. As for challenges faced, honestly our biggest problem was 
not realizing there was a template repo, and when we decided partway through that we should use 
Maven for dependencies, we had a bit of trouble making the switch. Besides that, there was the 
odd issue getting the DAO files to work with the service files, but overall it wasn’t too difficult.
