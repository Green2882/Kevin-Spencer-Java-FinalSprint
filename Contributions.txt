 - Spencer's Contributions: 
 For this project we each created our own branches, I was working on SpencerBranch.

 Kevin and I worked collabiratively on this project, bouncing ideas and problems off each other throughout the whole process.

 I mainly focused on GymMerchandiseManagement, MembershipManagement and WorkoutManagement

 The biggest challenge faced was swapping to Maven. 
 We originally were going to use JAR files to access BCrypt, but it wasn't working so we transitioned to Maven.
 Swapping over proved quite painful. 
 Downloading dependencies was fine but when we tried to bring them over, whole project nearly imploded.
 After the better part of a day spent googling and trying different fixes, we finally got it figured out and could start working again.

 Besides Maven and the JAR file debacle, without the template we originally had 3 seperate files in GymMerchandiceManagement.
 One for Food, Drinks and WorkoutGear which we noticed was going to be a problem down the line of trying to do queries in SQL.
 So, we merged all of the different files into one and added a type variable to Merch.java to differentiate between types of merch.

I mainly worked within the roles/users/test folder, but both of us ended up working in all sections 
at times whenever one of us needed help. As for challenges faced, honestly our biggest problem was 
not realizing there was a template repo, and when we decided partway through that we should use 
Maven for dependencies, we had a bit of trouble making the switch. Besides that, there was the 
odd issue getting the DAO files to work with the service files, but overall it wasn’t too difficult.
